# textual history Goethe's "Faust"

## faustii9+.xml
TXSTEP script to collate more than 9 version of Faust&nbsp;II (TUSTEP's vergleiche, vergleich-aufbereite).
## c4_recstr.xml
TXSTEP script to compare and separate variants from two later prints, depending on how they differ from an earlier one (TUSTEP's #kopiere). 

Goethe's "Helena | klassisch-romantische Phantasmagorie" which would later form the third act of "Faust&nbsp;II" was printed three times during Goethes lifetime (see http://beta.faustedition.net/archive_prints).
These three prints are:
* C.1 4 (final edition's vol. 4, pocket format but still octavo)
* C.2α 4 (final edition's vol. 4, identical in appearance, so-called double printing or "Doppeldruck" of C.1 4)
* C.3 4 (final edition's vol. 4, octavo format)

A corrected copy of C.1 served as basis for both of the latter editions.
This corrected copy is lost but may be reconstructed from the variants shared by C.2α and C.3.
The script compares the variants and copy them to separate files, depending on whether a reading is shared by the other of the two prints or not.
